# JeetCode
This repo contains my takes on solving LeetCode problems using the Java programming language.
Every solution class has a javadoc comment with a link to its respective problem. If you find that to
not be the case, please open an issue or a pull request!

## How to find a specific problem
You can find a specific problem in this repository by searching its number.
All solution classes' names contain a four-digit number at their end.
The number always contains leading zeros (i.e., **Leet #1** will be **0001**),
so keep that in mind when searching.
